1,toxicodendron radicans,Poison ivy,"September 1st, 2005","Today is September 1st, 2005. I guess it's been a year now since the last time we've walked along this path together. It still feels like yesterday when you stopped me from touching the three-leaved plant, yelling out from the other side of the tree, ""that's poison ivy!"". I wonder if anyone else since then got rashes from the same plant, 100 grams of urushiol coming into contact with skin. ",0,,denial
2,lagerstroemia indica,crepe myrtle,"September 2nd, 2005","Today is September 2nd, 2005. The Crepe Myrtles are still in bloom, pink dots that decorate the treescape. You told me to thank them for adding beauty to our lives for a ""whopping 100 days of flowering!!!"". Perhaps today is the last 100th day, though; everything seems dull---the once immensely vibrant pink fading into gray, gray, gray.",0,,bargaining
3,agave ovatifolia,whale's tongue agave,"September 3rd, 2005","September 3rd, 2005. The heat is unbearable today. Waves of hot rolling off of the cement. Whale's tongue agave; they flower once and die. We talked about the beauty of that singularity---how that moment of flowering is an ""extra special blip of time"" since it won't happen again. I wish I could take that back. You were the most eternally beautiful flower of my life. But you are gone. You are gone and I can't ever have you back! How foolish of me to ever think that makes things have more meaning.",10.00%,,anger
4,justicia spicigera,mexican honeysuckle,"September 4th, 2005","September 4th, 2005. Every night since the day you left this world, I've envisioned alternate realities where you stayed, a life where you, like sweet Mexican Honeysuckles, remained evergreen, blooming throughout the upcoming gray winter. We went on a thousand more walks together. You went on to earn your Master's in Botany. Our house was filled with canary dragon lilies and honey dandelions and everything in between. ",15.00%,,denial
5,nandina domestica,heavenly bamboo,"September 5th, 2005","September 5th, 2005. Heavenly bamboo--only named bamboo because the leaves look somewhat similar to bamboo tree leaves. Yet, it could never be an actual bamboo, eternally a shrub. Sorry, I know you'd probably be mad at me for insulting it. I think I'm getting better at keeping my shock in control when I see someone who looks like you. Surprisingly, I hate it when that happens. Jet black hair that shines a hint of blue under the sunlight. An obession with denim and a slight smile that reveals the top teeth. No matter how much any other being could emulate your features, they could never be a bamboo, could never be you, and that thought makes my heart twist for a split second each time.

6,maclura pomifera,osage orange,"September 6th, 2005","September 6th, 2005. The first time I knew I had fallen in love with you was when the osage orange dropped on your head. That big brain-like fruit bonked you and we both couldn't believe what just happened! We clutched our stomachs and laughed and laughed and laughed, and my vision was blurry with tears in my eyes, but through that haze I caught a glimpse of your face and I swear my heart skipped a beat and its rhythm has been different ever since. You giggled ""it's okay, osage I forgive you because you keep the mosquitoes away!""",30.00%,,denial
7,ficus carica,common fig,"September 7th, 2005","September 7th, 2005. I guess this year it is going to be a cold winter. The roads have iced over, the trees shocked in their roots, the animals have all either gone into hibernation or deceased. Even on these cold days, you were always one step ahead of the game. Did you pack your gloves, love? Come on now, it's freezing outside, wear a jacket! You would remind me. You even reminded the figs. There, there, I've crocheted a sweater for you so you'll be warm enough. It was a heart-warming sight to see -- someone caring for the world so much that they make sweaters for trees. Like figs, who don't need pollination to produce fruit, I knew then that you were someone who never needed anyone else to do good; this challenged my beliefs about love and attachment, this made me realize I wanted to be by your side even if you didn't need it. Now my love for you, leftover and iced over, pours into the way I make the sweaters for the figs now that you are gone.",40.00%,,depression
8,taxodium distichum,bald cypress,"September 8th, 2005","September 8th, 2005. The bald cypress is starting to balden, the needles dropping one by one. I liked watching them fall to the dirt. Piles of needles forming as the days go by. I wonder if you saw me now, I would appear like a bald cypress--my once full demeanor and soul fragmented, torn apart, and wisped away into a mere skeleton of who I used to feel like I was. I am happy you can't see me now, you can't see me now.",50.00%,,depression
9,nopalea cochenillifera,cochineal nopal cactus,"September 9th, 2005","September 9th, 2005. Some days I don't even take a step out of my bed. It is a cocoon underneath that green fluffy blanket we once shared, blocking out the future and the past, my thoughts, and my unbearable emotions. I don't have to perform life when I'm in there. I can just exist as a shell for this grief that consumes me, mindlessly and heartlessly breathing one by one by one. I wish I was a cochineal nopal cactus so that I could survive through this drought. I wouldn't even have to get up to drink water. I feel my desire to go live outside my cocoon, deep within my soul, underneath all the layers and blankets of suffocating melancholy, it is there still, just yet to be uncovered again. I wonder if I ever will be able to again.",60.00%,,depression
10,malvaviscus arboreus,turk's cap,"September 10th, 2005","Today is September 10th, 2005. I am strolling along our walk once again. It is a slightly warmer day; the world seems to remind me that I am still in Austin, winter never commits to the bit of being cold. I have your picture in my hand, the one that is normally in my wallet. I hold it up against the turk's cap, where it was once taken. You, with your dark eyes ever so soft, staying as still as possible as an albino hummingbird smells the plant's nectar. I squint and the lines between the photo and the world fade. You are here again, with your voice ringing in my ears, the breath of your movements gracing my skin, the light from your soul intensifiying the colors we live in. Then, the most surprising, wondrous thing happened, my dear, an oddly white bird came fluttering, buzzing towards my hand, still holding your photo up. It buzzed in and out of the space between my hand, the image, and the turk's cap, then finally it buzzed one last time towards me. It flew away, and there are puddles of my tears on concrete sidewalk. I am smiling, I am breathing, I am remembering you, and you are remembering me. I don't think I'll ever be the same, but I am learning to live again, not without you, because you will always be here, living within me, within the world you cared so deeply for. ",70.00%,,acceptance
